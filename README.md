## Yet Another Metroid 2 Remake Patcher ##
This tool is designed to support a modding workflow where changes are made to exported source files that are then patched into a data.win instead of the usual UTMT workflow of making changes directly in the data.win. This workflow makes it easier for multiple modders to collaborate on one project since everyone on the team can get the same data.win by supplying the patcher with the same base file.
