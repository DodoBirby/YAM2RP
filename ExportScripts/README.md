# YAM2RP Export Scripts
This folder contains the export scripts that YAM2RP assumes you are using to get data from the data.win.  
Sprites, Masks, and Backgrounds/Tilesets don't have any special script to extract them since they are just PNGs and it's presumed you're working on these files outside of UTMT.
Code is just .gml files with the source code. 
Sounds are just .wav (internal) or .ogg (external) files.

None of these scripts were written by me so all credits go to the original authors.
